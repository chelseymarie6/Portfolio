        <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hello! I'm Chelsey Dolan. This is my professional web development portfolio where I share all of my favorite work.</p>
          <span>It's also a work in progress...I am currently updating it with React, Sanity.io, Sass and a few other tricks. Stay tuned for a total revamp!</span>
          <p>When I am not working on my web development skills, I work full time in management consulting as program manager with skills in both product and project management.</p>
          <p>In my free time am often found at the beach with my dog, hiking or checking out a new local restaurant with my family. My toddler currently enjoys running in the opposite direction as me...so I guess I enjoy running too ðŸ¤¦</p>
